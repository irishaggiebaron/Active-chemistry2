		In this course, we are learning about <term>organic chemistry</term> and <term>biological chemistry</term>. Organic chemistry is the chemistry of carbon containing molecules whereas biological chemistry focuses on the chemicals and reactions that are necessary for the existence of life. Carbon plays a central role in biological chemistry because of its versatility, which you’ll explore more in the exercise below.

		Organic and biological molecules are often MUCH more complex than the simple covalent compounds that you drew structures of above. It’d be very nice to have a more straightforward way of determining the structure of a molecule than what we’ve already learned. Thankfully, Lewis structures contain a number of important patterns that we can take advantage of in order to correctly draw molecular structures much more quickly and easily than by using the steps covered previously. In the next set of exercises, you’ll establish some of these patterns.
