  "title": "Review of Lewis structures",
  "body": " Review of Lewis structures   Review of Lewis Structures   In this section we will review the rules for drawing Lewis structures and figuring out formal charges that you learned in a previous course. Lewis structures can easily be drawn by following the steps outlined below:    Count the number of valence electrons. Don’t forget to add or subtract electrons if the molecule has a charge!    Arrange the atoms and draw single bonds joining them together    Add lone pairs of electrons to atoms, trying to satisfy the octet rule    *If you run out of electrons and the octet rule isn’t satisfied, then move lone pairs of electrons to create multiple bonds. Repeat this until the octet rule is satisfied for each atom    **If an atom in the structure is in the 3 rd period or lower, then check the formal charge on the atoms. Try creating additional double bonds to that atom and re-evaluate the formal charges. Repeat this until the central atom has a charge of zero.     *This rule doesn’t always apply…only when there are insufficient electrons to satisfy the octet rule  **In this course, the only atoms that will do this are phosphorous and sulfur   To help with these steps, recall that valence electrons are those electrons in the outer shell of an atom. The number of valence electrons can be determined by determining the main group number that the element belongs to (or alternatively by counting the number of tall columns in the periodic table from left to right). We also need to recall that if an atom has a formal positive charge, then that number of electrons must be subtracted from the total; conversely for each negative charge an electron must be added to the total.  When drawing Lewis structures, we often need to evaluate the formal charge on an atom. To review, the way that this is done is as follows:     An atom “owns” all of the lone pairs of electrons on itself as well as one electron in each bond around it.     Draw Lewis dot structures for all of the molecules indicated below. Show all lone pairs of electrons in your structures.            A carbon with 4 lines that join to 4 hydrogens that surround it               A nitrogen with three lines joining to 3 different hydrogen atoms. There is also a lone pair of electrons on the central nitrogen atom.               A nitrogen atom with 4 single bonds to hydrogen atoms. The nitrogen atom has a positive charge.         (Put the carbon in the middle)      A carbon with a single bond to a hydrogen atom. The carbon also has a triple bond to a nitrogen atom. The nitrogen atom also has a lone pair of electrons.               Two carbons with a double bond linking them. Each carbon also has 2 single bonds to 2 different hydrogen atoms.               A carbon with a single bond to a hydrogen. That carbon also has a double bond to an oxygen. That oxygen has two lone pairs of electrons. The carbon also has a single bond to another oxygen atom. That oxygen has 3 lone pairs of electrons and a negative charge.               A carbon atom with 4 chlorines around it. Each chlorine is bound to the carbon by a single bond. Each chlorine has 3 lone pairs of electrons around it.               Phosphorous with 4 oxygens around it. There are 2 bonds to one of the oxygens and a single bond to the other three. The doubly bound oxygen has 2 lone pairs of the electrons. The singly bound oxygen atoms have 3 lone pairs of electrons and a negative charge        "

Organic chemistry is the chemistry of carbon containing molecules whereas biological chemistry focuses on the chemicals and reactions that are necessary for the existence of life. Carbon plays a central role in biological chemistry because of its versatility, which you’ll explore more in the exercise below.  Organic and biological molecules are often MUCH more complex than the simple covalent compounds that you drew structures of above. It’d be very nice to have a more straightforward way of determining the structure of a molecule than what we’ve already learned. Thankfully, Lewis structures contain a number of important patterns that we can take advantage of in order to correctly draw molecular structures much more quickly and easily than by using the steps covered previously. In the next set of exercises, you’ll establish some of these patterns.  "

  "body": " Organic chemistry, hydrocarbons, and alkanes  Summary:   Organic chemistry, hydrocarbons, and alkanes   Classification of organic molecules:  The distinction between alkanes, alkenes, alkynes, and aromatics has to deal with the types of bonds between the carbon atoms and their arrangement. Alkanes are the simplest type of hydrocarbon because they contain exclusively single bonds between the carbon atoms. Each carbon in every organic molecule needs to make 4 bonds . In a hydrocarbon, these bonds are either to another carbon atom or to a hydrogen atom. When there are only carbon-carbon single bonds in a hydrocarbon, the number of bonds to hydrogen atoms is higher than if there were double bonds or triple bonds (see the example below illustrating this for two carbon hydrocarbons. Since alkanes contain only C-C single bonds, they have the maximum number of hydrogen atoms and are thus said to be saturated with hydrogen atoms and are thus also called saturated hydrocarbons . Hydrocarbons that contain double and triple bonds contain less than the maximum number of hydrogen atoms and are thus called unsaturated hydrocarbons . These same definitions will apply in a later chapter when we discuss saturated and unsaturated fats.  Alkane:       Alkene:       Alkyne:       Now we are going to begin the process of naming organic molecules by learning how to name unbranched alkanes. This information is foundational for naming every other type of organic molecule and MUST be mastered early in this course. We name alkanes by counting the number of carbon atoms in the chain. The number of carbon atoms determines the prefix that will be used for the molecule name. See the figure below for the list of prefixes that must be memorized. The suffix used tells us the type of organic molecule that we’re naming. In the case of alkanes, the suffix is -ane. So a two carbon alkane would have the prefix eth- and the suffix -ane, creating the name ethane. Alkanes can occur as rings as well. In this course, we’ll only deal with naming compounds with a single ring. To name these compounds, we count the number of carbons and assign the appropriate prefix as before along with the suffix -ane. We also need to add an extra prefix of cyclo- at the beginning to indicate that it’s a ring. So a four carbon alkane ring would be called cyclobutene.

  "body": " Condensed structures and skeletal structures   Chemists are lazy: condensed structures and skeletal structures   In organic chemistry we need methods for drawing chemical structures that are as simple and straightforward as possible, particularly once molecules get to be larger and larger. While it is possible to draw the Lewis structure for decane, it is tedious and time consuming to draw its 10 carbon atoms, 22 hydrogens, and 31 bonds. To help with this chemists will typically draw a condensed structure or a skeletal structure instead of a Lewis structure.  A condensed structure treats each carbon atom and those atoms directly bound to it as a separate unit. For each of these units, we simply write the chemical formula. Showing single bonds is optional (but is frequently done if the structure branches; more on this in the next lesson). Double and triple bonds are always shown. Also, if there are multiple repeating units that are identical, they are often shown once in parentheses and a subscript is written outside to indicate how many of the units occur. Lone pairs of electrons are often omitted as well. See the examples below:  A skeletal structure takes away the need to write any carbon atoms or the hydrogens that are attached to them. Each carbon atom and its associated hydrogens are implied by the end of a line segment. The lines show the arrangement of the bonds between each of the carbon atoms. How are we supposed to know where the hydrogens are then? We have to remember that carbon always forms 4 bonds. So if a carbon has two bonds to other carbons shown, then the remaining two unshown bonds must be to two hydrogen atoms.  In some cases, the condensed structure drawing method and the skeletal structure drawing method are combined together. See the example below.

When considering the geometry and shape of a molecule, we very often start with the geometry and shape around an individual atom. We then determine the number of electron groups (either lone pairs of electrons or atoms that are directly bound to the central atom). These electron groups spread out as far as possible in 3-dimensional space. The arrangement of the electron groups is called the electron geometry . The possible electron groups that we’ll encounter in this course are linear (2 groups), trigonal planar (3 groups), and tetrahedral (4 groups). In organic chemistry, by far the most common electron geometry is tetrahedral.

Dashes are meant to represent bonds that are pointed away from the viewer. So a tetrahedral shape for methane can be represented as shown below:      "

  "body": " Naming Branched Alkanes   Summary:    Naming branched alkanes   We’ve learned how to name straight chain alkanes and alkanes that have ring structures. What about alkanes that have branches? If these branches contain carbon atoms, they are called alkyl groups . We name alkyl groups by counting the number of carbon atoms in the alkyl group and using the same prefixes that we used for naming alkanes in 11.1. We then add a -yl suffix. So a one carbon alkyl group is called a methyl group.  Now that we understand alkyl groups, we’re ready to begin naming branched alkanes. To do this, we follow the steps listed below for structures that are NOT rings:    Identify the longest carbon chain    This is the parent chain    Count the number of carbons and name it as-if it had no substituents      Number the carbons on the parent chain    Start on the end that is closest to the first substituent    If there is a tie, start on the end that is closest to the 2 nd substituent…or the 3 rd …etc…    If there is still a tie after going through all of the substituents, give preference to the alkyl group substituent that comes first alphabetically        Name each substituent. Assign each substituent a number based on the carbon of the parent chain that it is bound to and put the number in front of the substituent name. Numbers are separated from letters by hyphens.    Combine identical alkyl groups together keeping ALL of their numbers, listed in numerical order, separated by commas. Add a prefix (see the table below) to indicate the number of the alkyl groups.    List the substituents in alphabetical order (ignoring their prefixes that state the number of that type of substituent). List the substituents first, then the name of the parent chain.

If we number the longest carbon chain from left to right, we reach the first substituent at carbon #2. If we instead numbered right to left, we’d reach the first substituent at carbon #5. We should number left to right     Name each substituent. Assign each substituent a number based on the carbon of the parent chain that it is bound to and put the number in front of the substituent name. Numbers are separated from letters by hyphens.     2-methyl 3-methyl and 5-ethyl are our substituents     Combine identical alkyl groups together keeping ALL of their numbers, listed in numerical order, separated by commas. Add a prefix (see the table below) to indicate the number of the alkyl groups).    We have two methyl groups: 2,3-dimethyl    List the substituents in alphabetical order (ignoring their prefixes that state the number of that type of substituent).
